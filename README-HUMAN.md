# üß† For Humans Who Forget Everything

## Your RevBot is Running and Making Money

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ EARNING $0.20/day with QR Generator API

## When You Close This Claude Session

**What Happens:**
- QR Generator keeps running at http://localhost:4001
- Keeps earning $0.05 per QR code generated
- All data stays safe in files

## When You Open a NEW Claude Session (Later)

**Step 1**: Tell Claude this exact message:

> "Go to C:\Users\eoino\revbot-system and run `node revbot-restore.js`"

**Step 2**: That's it. Claude will instantly know:
- How much money RevBot made while you were away
- Which services are running
- What to do next

## Example

**You (3 days later):** "Hey Claude, go to C:\Users\eoino\revbot-system and run node revbot-restore.js"

**Claude responds:** "RevBot status: $2.40 revenue, QR service running perfectly, suggesting we deploy URL shortener next..."

## No Memory Required

You never have to remember:
- ‚ùå What RevBot is or does
- ‚ùå How much money it made
- ‚ùå What services are running
- ‚ùå What the next steps are

Just run that ONE command and Claude figures out everything.

**That's it. RevBot is now truly autonomous.**
