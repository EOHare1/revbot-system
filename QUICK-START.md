# ðŸ¤– RevBot Quick Start - For Humans Who Forget

## When You Open a NEW Claude Session

**You only need to remember ONE thing:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\eoino\revbot-system && node revbot-restore.js
```

That's it. This command will:
âœ… Check if RevBot is still running
âœ… Show you current revenue and status
âœ… Load all business state automatically
âœ… Tell you exactly what to do next

## What This Looks Like

**You in new Claude session:**
"Hey Claude, run `node revbot-restore.js` in the revbot-system folder"

**Claude gets everything instantly:**
- Current revenue: $X.XX
- Services running: Yes/No
- Business history: Complete
- Next actions: Specific commands

## No Memory Required

You literally never have to remember:
- How much revenue you made
- Which services are running
- What decisions were made
- What to do next

The restore script tells Claude everything automatically.

## Test It Right Now

Let's test this system:

1. **Run the restore script**
2. **Verify it works**
3. **Then you can safely close this session**
